# BMP-to-B-W

Possibly the project I am most proud of. Takes a BMP image and converts each pixel to a shade of gray by altering the bytes of code one by one. 
Your choice of three methods of determining the shade of gray, upload any BMP you like, or see some of my results in the Test Images folder.
